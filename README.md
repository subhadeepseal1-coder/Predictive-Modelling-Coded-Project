# Predictive-Modelling-Coded-Project
ShowTime - OTT Data Analysis
Course:Predictive Modeling
This project analyzes content data to develop a linear regression model predicting first-day viewership on ShowTime's OTT platform. By identifying key driver variables, we aim to optimize content scheduling, marketing strategies, and platform features to increase viewership and enhance user engagement.

Skills & Tools Covered:
Descriptive Analytics
Exploratory Data Analysis
Linear regression
Linear regression assumptions
Multiple linear regression
Regression metrics
My Learnings:
📊 1. Descriptive & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gained experience in summarizing and visualizing content performance data (e.g., genre, runtime, release timing). Identified patterns and correlations between content features and first-day viewership. Used EDA to uncover potential driver variables such as content type, cast popularity, promotion efforts, and release day. 🔍 2. Linear Regression Modeling: Developed a simple and multiple linear regression model to predict first-day viewership. Interpreted regression coefficients to understand how each variable influences viewership. 📐 3. Regression Assumptions: Evaluated key linear regression assumptions such as: Linearity Normality of residuals Homoscedasticity Multicollinearity (checked using VIF) Learned to address violations of assumptions for more robust models. 📈 4. Model Performance Evaluation: Assessed model accuracy and explanatory power using regression metrics, including: R-squared Adjusted R-squared Mean Absolute Error (MAE) Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) 🧠 5. Business Application & Strategy: Identified key drivers of viewership, enabling ShowTime to: Optimize content release timing Improve marketing strategies based on content characteristics Enhance platform engagement features Provided actionable insights to help maximize first-day success of new content. 💡 Overall Takeaway: Learned how to apply linear and multiple regression techniques to predict performance metrics in a real-world OTT scenario. This project strengthened my ability to interpret regression results for strategic decision-making in content planning and marketing.
